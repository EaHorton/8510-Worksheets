Hi! Today, we'll be learning about a super easy and super practical function – separate_rows().

As I'm sure you can gather from the name, separate_rows() separates rows! This is not to be confused with its sibling - separate_columns() - which you are far more likely to use. However, this function just might save you lots of time some day.

```{r}
library(tidyr)
?separate_rows()
```

This function is contained in the tidyr package. This does not come as a surpirse because separate_rows() is most often used to tidy your dataset. If a row contains multiple values, it is in violation of one of the foundational tidy data rules – that each cell should contain a single value. Separate_rows() will take the contents of a single row and convert it into two.

```{r}
sample <- read_csv("Sample_separate_rows() - Sheet1.csv")
```

```{r}
#separate_rows(data, column, where to split it)
separate_rows(sample, group, sep = ",")
```
